# Test Markdown Document

This is a test document to verify that our markdown conversion is working properly.

## Formatting Tests

Here are some **bold** and *italic* text examples. We can also have ***bold and italic*** text together.

We can also use __underscores__ for _emphasis_ and ___both___ together.

## Lists

Here's an unordered list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Nested item 2.1
  * Nested item 2.2
* Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

Here's an inline `code` example.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    # This is a comment
    return True
```

## Links and Images

## Blockquotes
