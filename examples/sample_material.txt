What are proteins? (Definition, biological importance) 

Amino acids: structure, types, and properties 

Peptide bonds and protein synthesis (translation process) 

Overview of central dogma of molecular biology: DNA → RNA → Protein 

Structures and What is the protein backbone? Role in defining 3D shape 

Backbone torsion angles (ϕ, ψ, ω) and Ramachandran plot 

Primary structure: amino acid sequence 

Secondary structure: α-helices, β-sheets, loops 

Tertiary structure: overall 3D shape 

Quaternary structure: multimeric complexes 

Forces driving protein folding: hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, hydrophobic packing 

Levinthal’s Paradox 

Anfinsen’s experiment 

Thermodynamics of folding: energy landscapes, funnel model
