# Gemini API Integration Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The Gemini API integration is not working because the API key has expired. The error message from the Gemini API is:

```
API key expired. Please renew the API key. [reason: "API_KEY_INVALID"]
```

## Changes Made
1. Updated the `GeminiClient` class in `src/utils/llm_wrapper.py` to:
   - Add support for the `gemini-2.0-flash` model
   - Implement a more robust message handling approach similar to the working JavaScript implementation
   - Add multiple fallback methods to handle different API response scenarios
   - Update the generation configuration to match the working JavaScript implementation

2. Created a test script (`test_gemini_fixed.py`) that:
   - Tests different approaches to calling the Gemini API
   - Provides detailed error messages for debugging

## Required Action
**You need to obtain a new Gemini API key:**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Update your `.env` file with the new key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

## Testing After Getting a New API Key
After updating your API key, you can test if the integration is working by running:

```bash
python test_gemini_fixed.py
```

If successful, you should see responses from the Gemini API instead of error messages.

## Additional Notes
- The code has been updated to support both `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-2.0-flash` models
- The implementation now follows a similar pattern to the working JavaScript implementation you shared
- Multiple fallback methods have been added to increase reliability
