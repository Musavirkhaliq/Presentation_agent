# Thermodynamics of Protein Folding: The Energy Landscape

*   **The Energy Landscape: A Funnel for Folding**
    *   Proteins don't explore *every* possible conformation. Instead, they navigate an energy landscape.
    *   **Funnel Model:** Visualizes folding as a "funnel" guiding the protein towards its native state.

*   **Driving Forces**
    *   The driving force is the overall *decrease* in free energy (ΔG < 0).
    *   This includes:
        *   Favorable enthalpy (ΔH) from bonds, hydrophobic effect.
        *   Favorable entropy (ΔS) from water release around hydrophobic regions.

---

# Thermodynamics of Protein Folding: The Energy Landscape (Part 2)

*   **Global Energy Minimum**
    *   The *native state* represents the global energy minimum within the funnel.
    *   It's the most stable and functional conformation.

*   **Visual Suggestions:**
    *   Include a diagram of a folding funnel with energy levels depicted on the y-axis and conformational space on the x-axis. Show the protein starting at the top (unfolded) and moving down the funnel to the native state at the bottom.
    *   Insert a 3D structure of a folded protein (e.g., myoglobin) to represent the native state/global minimum.
    *   A graphic could illustrate the unfolded protein as high energy state and folded state as low energy state.
