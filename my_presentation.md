# Thermodynamics of Protein Folding: The Energy Landscape (Part 2)

*   **Folding Intermediates and Pathways:**
    *   Folding is not always a direct path; intermediates may form.
    *   Molten globule: A compact, partially folded state with native-like secondary structure but lacking tight tertiary packing.
    *   The energy landscape allows for multiple pathways to the native state.

# Thermodynamics of Protein Folding: The Energy Landscape (Part 3)

*   **Chaperones Assist Folding:**
    *   Visual: Illustrate a chaperone protein (e.g., GroEL/ES system or Hsp70) interacting with a partially folded protein.
    *   Chaperones prevent aggregation and misfolding by binding to unfolded or partially folded proteins.
    *   Provide a protected environment for proper folding.
    *   Examples: Hsp70, GroEL/ES, chaperonins.

*   **Key Takeaway:** Protein folding is thermodynamically driven, guided by the energy landscape, and sometimes requires assistance from chaperones to reach the functional native state.
